The 1x drivetrain is a combination of Shimano Altus & Shimano Acera. With Shimano being one of the most trusted names in the industry, you know you're in good hands. The suspension fork provides an unmatched level of comfort when faced with uneven terrain, while the WTB Riddler tires provide much needed traction when the path gets a bit slippery. Steer clear of those damp leaf piles!")

It utilizes a steel frame construction instead of alloy, and it also has a 2x drivetrain, meaning you'll have a few more gear options to cycle through (Heh...cycle. I love an accidental pun!). Another factor to consider is that the aforementioned Heist X2 has a sizing chart similar to your clothing (i.e. S, M, L, & XL). The Nicasio follows the traditional frame size in centimeter format, providing you with a much more accurate fit.")
